# `tpm`

The files in this directory are used to process the raw image files of the
tethered beads. These scripts are used both in the acquisition and
post-processing of the image data to generate `.mat` files containing properties
of each bead trace. Please see [Lovely *et. al* 2015,
PNAS](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/14/E1715.short) for a description of how
to use this software.
