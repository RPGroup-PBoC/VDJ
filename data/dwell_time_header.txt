# ORIGIN:
#     This Work
#
# NOTES:
#   This file contains the dwell time information for each observed paired
#   complex state, regardless of whether it lead to a cleavage event or simple 
#   unlooping event. 
#   
# COLUMN DESCRIPTIONS:
#   dwell_time_min: 
#        The lifetime of the paired complex state (dwell time) in minutes
#   cut: 
#        Boolean (1, 0) report of whether the paired complex lead to a cleavage
#        event or not. A cleavage event is denoted by 1 and an unlooping event 
#        denoted by 0.
#   replicate: 
#       An integer representation of a unique experimental replicate.
#   date:
#       The date of the experiment in YYMMDD format. 
#   salt:
#       The bivalent cation used to stabilize the RAG-DNA interaction. Mg
#       corresponds to magnesium 2+ and Ca corresponds to calcium 2+. Cleavage is
#        inhibited in the calcium condition.
#   hmgb1:
#       Concentration of HMGB1 in the reaction buffer which stabilizes RAG-DNA 
#       binding. All concentrations are given in nM
