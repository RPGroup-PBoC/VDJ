# ORIGIN:
#       This study
#  
# NOTES:
#    This file considers how many paired complexes are observed per tracked bead
#   across all experiments and replicates. Each observed bead per replicate is given
#   a unique identifier such that the largest number per replicate is the total
#   number of beads tracked in that experiment. 
#
# COLUMN DESCRIPTIONS:
#   n_loops: (integer)
#       The total number of paired complexes (loops) observed for a particular
#       bead. There is no distinction between simple unlooping or DNA cleavage. 
#   bead_idx: (integer)
#       An arbitrary integer identifier for the bead tracked in a single
#       experimental replicate.
#   replicate: (integer)
#       A unique integer indicating the experimental replicate
#   mutant: (string)
#       The name of the mutant. Endogenous sequences are denoted by either a
#       "V", "DFL", or "WT" at the beginning of the name. Point mutants are prefixed with a
#       "12"  and followed by an abbreviated region of the mutant, "Hept" for
#       heptamer, "Spac" for spacer, or "Non" for nonamer. The mutations are given as
#       the original nucleotide at that position, the index of that nucleotide from the
#       beginning of the sequence region, and the identity of the mutation. For example,
#       A mutation in the 4th position of the spacer region from a cytosine to thymine
#       would be denoted as "12SpacC4T".
#   date: (integer)
#       The date of the experiment in YYMMDD format.
#   salt: (string)
#       Identity of the bivalent cation used to stabilize the RAG-DNA
#       interaction. Mg corresponds to magnesium 2+ and Ca for calcium 2+. DNA cleavage
#       is inhibited in the presence of calcium.
#   hmgb1: (float) 
#       The concentration of HMGB1 in the reaction buffer in nM.
