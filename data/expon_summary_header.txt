# ORIGIN:
#   This study
# 
# NOTES:
#   This file contains the summary statistics for the estimation of the
#   exponential waiting time of each mutant in each condition. These values are 
#   computed from the numerical sampling of the posterior distribution.
#
# COLUMN DESCRIPTIONS:
#   parameter: (string)
#       Identity of the parameter. The only reported parameter is tau.
#   dimension: (integer, 1)  
#       Dimension of the parameter. All values are 1 as this was not sampled as
#       a hierarchical model.
#   mean: (float)
#       Mean value of the posterior samples for the parameter.
#   mode: (float)
#       Mode of the posterior samples. This is computed as the value of the
#       parameter when the value of the log posterior is maximized.
#   median: (float)
#       Median of the posterior samples for the parameter.
#   hpd_min: (float)
#       Lower bound of the narrowest window of the posterior samples which
#       contains the corresponding fraction of the probability mass.
#   hpd_max: (float)
#       Upper bound of the narrowest window of the posterior samples which
#       contains the corresponding fraction of the probability mass.
#   mass_fraction: (float, 0.95)
#       The mass fraction for which `hpd_min` and `hpd_max` are computed. 
#   mutant: (string)
#       The name of the mutant. Endogenous sequences are denoted by either a
#       "V", "DFL", or "WT" at the beginning of the name. Point mutants are prefixed with a
#       "12"  and followed by an abbreviated region of the mutant, "Hept" for
#       heptamer, "Spac" for spacer, or "Non" for nonamer. The mutations are given as
#       the original nucleotide at that position, the index of that nucleotide from the
#       beginning of the sequence region, and the identity of the mutation. For example,
#       A mutation in the 4th position of the spacer region from a cytosine to thymine
#       would be denoted as "12SpacC4T".
#   seq: (string)
#       Sequence for that particular mutant.
#   n_muts: (integer):
#       Number of mutations the corresponding mutant is separated from the 
#       reference sequence V4-57-1, annotated as "WT12rss".
#   salt: (string)
#       Identity of the bivalent ion which stabilizes the RAG-DNA interaction.
#       Mg corresponds to magnesium 2+ and Ca to calcium 2+. DNA cleavage is not
#       possible in the presence of calcium and absence of magnesium.
