# ORIGIN:
#   This study
# 
# NOTES:
#   This file contains the numerically computed posterior distributions for the
#   cleavage probability of each mutant. This file is used for display purposes
#   only. The reported values for the cleavage probability are analytically
#   calculated.
#
# COLUMN DESCRIPTIONS:
#   index: (integer)
#       Integer identifier of the row. This has no real purpose other than
#       ensuring order of the posteriors when iterating.
#   probability: (float)
#       Probability of cleavage of a paired complex. This is *not* the posterior
#       probability.
#   posterior: (float)
#       Numerically computed posterior probability of the corresponding cleavage
#       probability.
#   mutant: (string)
#       The name of the mutant. Endogenous sequences are denoted by either a
#       "V", "DFL", or "WT" at the beginning of the name. Point mutants are prefixed with a
#       "12"  and followed by an abbreviated region of the mutant, "Hept" for
#       heptamer, "Spac" for spacer, or "Non" for nonamer. The mutations are given as
#       the original nucleotide at that position, the index of that nucleotide from the
#       beginning of the sequence region, and the identity of the mutation. For example,
#       A mutation in the 4th position of the spacer region from a cytosine to thymine
#       would be denoted as "12SpacC4T".
#   salt: (string)
#       The identity of the bivalent cation used to stabilize the RAG-DNA
#       interaction in the reaction buffer. Mg corresponds to magnesium 2+ and Ca to
#       calcium 2+. Cleavage is not possible when Ca 2+ is included.
#   hmgb1: (float)
#       Concentration of HMGB1 in the reaction buffer in nM.
#   n_muts: (float, treated as int)
#       The number of mutations away from the reference sequence (V4-57-1),
#       annotated as "WT12rss". This is used for restricting posteriors to point
#       mutations for plotting.
