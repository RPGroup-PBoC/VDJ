# ORIGIN:
#   This study.
#
# NOTES:
#   This file contains the summary statistics of the bootstrap analysis for the 
#   calculated looping frequency, defined as the number of observed loops
#   divided by the number of tracked beads. All resampling was performed
#   1,000,000 times. Percentiles are provided as confidence intervals of the  
#   resampled distributions.
#
# COLUMN DESCRIPTIONS:
#   high: (float)
#       The upper bound of confidence interval.
#   hmgb1: (float)
#       The concentration of HMGB1 in the reaction buffer in nM.
#   loops_per_bead: (float)
#       The experimentally observed looping frequency for that particular
#       mutant.
#   low: (float)
#       The lower bound of the confidence interval.
#   mutant: (string)
#     The name of the mutant. Endogenous sequences are denoted by either a
#     "V", "DFL", or "WT" at the beginning of the name. Point mutants are prefixed with a
#     "12"  and followed by an abbreviated region of the mutant, "Hept" for
#     heptamer, "Spac" for spacer, or "Non" for nonamer. The mutations are given as
#     the original nucleotide at that position, the index of that nucleotide from the
#     beginning of the sequence region, and the identity of the mutation. For example,
#     A mutation in the 4th position of the spacer region from a cytosine to thymine
#     would be denoted as "12SpacC4T".
#   n_beads: (float treated as integer)
#       The total number of beads tracked in that particular experiment. 
#   percentile: (float)
#       The percentile of the calculated confidence interval.
#   salt: (string)
#       The identity of the divalent salt in the reaction buffer. Mg corresponds
#       to magnesium 2+ and Ca for calcium 2+. DNA cleavage is inhibited in the presence
#       of calcium.
