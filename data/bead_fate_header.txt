# ORIGIN:
#   This study.
# 
# NOTES:
#   This file contains information regarding the fraction of observed paired
#   complexes which lead to a cleavage event.
#
# COLUMN DESCRIPTIONS:
#   n_loops: (integer)
#       The number of observed paired complexes in the given experiment and replicate.
#   n_cuts: (integer)
#       The number of observed cleavage events in the given experiment and
#       replicate.
#   replicate: (integer)
#       Integer identifier of the experimental replicate.
#   mutant: (string)
#       The name of the mutant. Endogenous sequences are denoted by either a
#       "V", "DFL", or "WT" at the beginning of the name. Point mutants are prefixed with a
#       "12"  and followed by an abbreviated region of the mutant, "Hept" for
#       heptamer, "Spac" for spacer, or "Non" for nonamer. The mutations are given as
#       the original nucleotide at that position, the index of that nucleotide from the
#       beginning of the sequence region, and the identity of the mutation. For example,
#       A mutation in the 4th position of the spacer region from a cytosine to thymine
#       would be denoted as "12SpacC4T".
#   date: (integer)
#       Date of the experiment in YYMMDD format. 
#   salt: (string)
#       Identity of the bivalent cation used to stabilize the RAG-DNA
#       interaction. Mg corresponds to magnesium 2+ and Ca for calcium 2+. DNA cleavage
#       is not possible in the presence of calcium and absence of magnesium.
#   hmgb1: (float)
#       Concentration of HMGB1 in the reaction buffer in nM.
