# ORIGIN:
#   This study
# 
# NOTES:
#   This file contains the numerically computed posterior distributions for the
#   cleavage probability of each mutant. This file is used for display purposes
#   only. The reported values for the cleavage probability are analytically
#   calculated.
#
# COLUMN DESCRIPTIONS:
#   mutant: (string)
#       The name of the mutant. Endogenous sequences are denoted by either a
#       "V", "DFL", or "WT" at the beginning of the name. Point mutants are prefixed with a
#       "12"  and followed by an abbreviated region of the mutant, "Hept" for
#       heptamer, "Spac" for spacer, or "Non" for nonamer. The mutations are given as
#       the original nucleotide at that position, the index of that nucleotide from the
#       beginning of the sequence region, and the identity of the mutation. For example,
#       A mutation in the 4th position of the spacer region from a cytosine to thymine
#       would be denoted as "12SpacC4T".
#   salt: (string)
#       The identity of the bivalent cation used to stabilize the RAG-DNA
#       interaction in the reaction buffer. Mg corresponds to magnesium 2+ and Ca to
#       calcium 2+. Cleavage is not possible when Ca 2+ is included.
#   hmgb1: (float)
#       Concentration of HMGB1 in the reaction buffer in nM.
#   n_loops: (integer)
#       The total number of observed PC complexes.
#   n_cuts: (integer)
#       The total number of observed loops that lead to cleavage.
#   mean: (float)
#       The computed mean of the gaussian approximation of the posterior. This 
#       is the most-likely probability of cleavage
#   n_muts: (float, treated as integer)
#       The number of mutations the corresponding mutant is away from the
#       reference sequence V4-57-1
