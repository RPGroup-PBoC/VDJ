# ORIGIN:
#   This study.
#
# NOTES:
#   This file contains all sampling output from the estimation of the
#   exponential leaving rate tau. This sampling output is generated by Pystan,
#   the Python interface for the Stan HMC sampler.
#
# COLUMN DESCRIPTIONS:
#   chain: (integer)
#       Identifier for the sampler chain. Maximum is 4. 
#   draw: (integer)
#       Number of the sample draw from the posterior.
#   warmup: (bool)
#       Boolean identifier for whether a sample was from the warmup (1) or
#       sampling (0) stage.
#   tau: (float)
#       Value of the average waiting time tau from which the posterior
#       probability is calculated.
#   lp__: (float)
#       Value of the log posterior at the corresponding parameter value. 
#   accept_stat__: (float)
#       Value of the step acceptance statistic. 
#   stepsize__: (float)
#       Step size of the sampler on the gradient.
#   treedepth__: (integer)
#       Recursive treedepth of the sampler. 
#   n_leapfrog__: (integer)
#       Number of leapfrog transitions taken along the gradient.
#   divergent__:  (bool)
#       Boolean indicator of a divergent sample (1 being divergent, 0 being
#       not.)
#   energy__: (float)
#       Energy of the sampler at a given sample.
#   mutant: (string)
#       The name of the mutant. Endogenous sequences are denoted by either a
#       "V", "DFL", or "WT" at the beginning of the name. Point mutants are prefixed with a
#       "12"  and followed by an abbreviated region of the mutant, "Hept" for
#       heptamer, "Spac" for spacer, or "Non" for nonamer. The mutations are given as
#       the original nucleotide at that position, the index of that nucleotide from the
#       beginning of the sequence region, and the identity of the mutation. For example,
#       A mutation in the 4th position of the spacer region from a cytosine to thymine
#       would be denoted as "12SpacC4T".
#   seq: (integer, -1)
#       Residual column that can be ignored.
#   n_muts: (integer)
#       Number of mutations away from the reference sequence V4-57-1 (annotated
#       as "WT12rss")
#   salt: (string)
#       Identity of the bivalent cation used in the reaction buffer. Mg
#       corresponds to magnesium 2+ and Ca for calcium 2+. Cleavage is inhibited in the
#       presence of calcium.
