In this work, we used Tethered Particle Motion to examine several key stages in
RAG-V(D)J recombination at single molecule resolution. The figure below can be
used to compare and contrast these key steps between endogenous RSS sequences
known to be used with differing frequencies *in vivo.* Two endogenous sequences
can be compared at once by selecting your desired RSS sequence from the corresponding
dropdown menu. This figure was created using the [Bokeh plotting
library](http://bokeh.pydata.org). The code used to generate it can be downloaded from the
[Code]({{site.baseurl}}/code) page of this website. An offline version of the figure [can be downloaded here]({{site.baseurl}}/figures/endogenous_sequence_explorer.html).
