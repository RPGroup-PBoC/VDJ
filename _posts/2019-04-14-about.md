## Abstract

Developing lymphocytes of jawed vertebrates cleave and combine distinct 
gene segments to assemble antigen-receptor genes. This process called 
V(D)J recombination involves the RAG recombinase binding and cutting 
recombination signal sequences (RSSs) composed of conserved heptamer 
and nonamer sequences flanking less well-conserved 12- or 23-bp spacers. 
Little quantitative information is known about the contributions of 
individual RSS positions over the course of the RAG-RSS interaction. 
We employ a single-molecule method known as tethered particle motion to 
track the formation, lifetime, and cleavage of individual RAG-12RSS-23RSS 
paired complexes (PCs) for numerous synthetic and endogenous 12RSSs. We 
reveal that single-bp changes, including in the 12RSS spacer, can 
significantly and selectively alter PC formation or the probability of 
RAG-mediated cleavage in the PC. We find that some rarely-used endogenous 
gene segments can be mapped directly to poor RAG binding on their adjacent 12RSSs. 
Finally, we find that while abrogating RSS nicking with Ca<sup>2+</sup> leads to substantially
shorter PC lifetimes, analysis of the complete lifetime distributions of any 12RSS
even on this reduced system reveals that the process of exiting the PC involves 
unidentified molecular details whose involvement in RAG-RSS dynamics are
crucial to quantitatively capture kinetics in V(D)J recombination.
