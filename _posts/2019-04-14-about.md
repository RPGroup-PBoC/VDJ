## Abstract

The immune system of jawed vertebrates undergoes large-scale reorganization of
spatially disparate gene segments through a process known as V(D)J recombination
to assemble functional antigen-receptor genes. The RAG1-RAG2 protein complex (RAG)
initiates this process by binding to genomic recombination signal sequences (RSSs)
composed of conserved heptamer and nonamer sequences flanking a less well
conserved  12- or 23-bp spacer. The
sequence specificity has not been quantitatively characterized,
obfuscating their importance in gene segment usage \textit{in vivo}. Here, we
employ a single-molecule method known as tethered particle motion (TPM) to
quantify the formation, stability, and cleavage of the RAG-12RSS-23RSS paired 
complex (PC) for numerous endogenous and synthetic 12RSSs. We find
that the rare usage of some endogenous sequences can be mapped
directly to the sequence of the 12RSS which results in weak RAG-RSS
binding. The sequence of the 12RSS, however, cannot explain the
high-frequency usage of other endogenous sequences, suggesting other factors that are not
recapitulated in our system. We explore the
sequence space around a single endogenous RSS by making 40 unique point mutations
and characterizing their dynamics. This reveals that point mutations tend to
influence RAG function based on their position: loss of cleavage function
(first three  positions of the heptamer); reduced propensity for forming the
PC (last four base pairs of the heptamer positions or the nonamer); or
variable effects on paired complex formation (spacer). Further
analysis illustrates that nicking of the DNA is not required to form PCs,
although nicked PCs are more stable.


## Significance
V(D)J recombination is a genomic cut-and-paste process for generating
diverse antigen-receptor repertoires. The RAG enzyme brings separate
gene segments together by
binding the neighboring sequences called RSSs, forming a paired complex (PC) before cutting the DNA. There are
limited quantitative studies of the sequence-dependent dynamics of the crucial
intermediate steps of PC formation and cleavage. Here, we quantify individual RAG-DNA dynamics 
with various RSSs. While RSSs of frequently-used segments do not comparatively enhance
PC formation or cleavage, the rare use of some segments can be explained
by their neighboring RSSs crippling either PC formation and/or cleavage. Furthermore, 
PC lifetimes reveal DNA-nicking is not required for forming the PC, but
PCs with nicks are more stable.
