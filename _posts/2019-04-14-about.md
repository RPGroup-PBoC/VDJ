## Abstract

Developing lymphocytes in the immune system of jawed vertebrates assemble
antigen-receptor genes by undergoing large-scale reorganization of
spatially separated V, D, and J gene segments through a process known as
V(D)J recombination. The RAG protein initiates this process by binding and
cutting recombination signal sequences (RSSs) composed of conserved
heptamer and nonamer sequences flanking less well-conserved 12- or 23-bp
spacers. Little quantitative information is known about the contributions of
individual RSS positions over the course of the RAG-RSS interaction. We
employ a single-molecule method known as tethered particle motion to quantify
the formation, stability, and cleavage of the RAG-12RSS-23RSS paired complex
(PC) for numerous synthetic and endogenous 12RSSs. We thoroughly investigate
the sequence space around a RSS by making 40 different single-bp changes and
characterizing the reaction dynamics. We reveal that single-bp changes affect
RAG function based on their position: loss of cleavage function (first three
positions of the heptamer); reduced propensity for forming the PC (the
nonamer and last four bp of the heptamer); or variable effects on PC
formation (spacer). We find that the rare usage of some endogenous gene
segments can be mapped directly to their adjacent 12RSSs to which RAG binds
weakly. The 12RSS, however, cannot ex- plain the high-frequency usage of
other gene segments. Finally, we find that RSS nicking, while not required
for PC formation, substantially stabilizes the PC. Our findings provide
detailed insights into the contribution of individual RSS positions to steps
of the RAG-RSS re- action that previously have been difficult to assess
quantitatively.

## Significance
V(D)J recombination is a genomic cut-and-paste process for generating diverse
antigen-receptor repertoires. The RAG enzyme brings separate gene segments
together by binding the neighboring sequences called RSSs, forming a paired
complex (PC) before cutting the DNA. There are limited quantitative studies
of the sequence-dependent dynamics of the crucial inter- mediate steps of PC
formation and cleavage. Here, we quantify individual RAG-DNA dynamics for
various RSSs. While RSSs of frequently-used segments do not comparatively
enhance PC formation or cleavage, the rare use of some segments can be
explained by their neighboring RSSs crippling PC formation and/or cleavage.
Furthermore, PC lifetimes reveal DNA-nicking is not required for forming the
PC, but PCs with nicks are more stable.
