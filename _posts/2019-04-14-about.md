## Abstract

The immune systems of jawed vertebrates undergo large-scale reor- ganization
of V, D and J gene segments through a process known as V(D)J recombination to
assemble antibody and T-cell receptor genes. The RAG1-RAG2 protein complex
(RAG) initiates this genomic reorganization by binding to recombination
signal sequences (RSSs) composed of conserved heptamer and nonamer sequences
flanking less well conserved 12- or 23-bp long spacer sequences. DNA sequence
effects on the RAG-RSS dynamics have not been extensively studied at a
quantitative level. We employ a single-molecule method known as tethered
particle motion (TPM) to determine whether the formation, stability and
cleavage of the RAG-12RSS-23RSS paired complex are affected by the choice of
both endogenous and synthetic 12RSSs. Although the high-frequency usage of
some gene segments cannot be explained by their RSSs, which are not observed
to be involved in more frequent formation or cleavage of paired complexes
(PCs) relative to the level of most other endogenous RSSs studied here, the
rare usage of some gene segments can be attributed to the poor binding of RAG
to their adjacent RSSs. Analysis of synthetic 12RSSs reveals that single
point mutations tend to influence RAG function in one of three ways depending
upon their position in the RSS: loss of cleavage function (first three
positions of the heptamer); reduced propensity for forming the PC (last four
base pairs of the heptamer positions or the nonamer); or variable effects on
paired complex formation (spacer). From further probing the tethered bead
trajectories in the assay to obtain deeper insights into the RAG-RSS
dynamics, we verify that RAG does not need to nick the DNA in order to form
the paired complex, but when RAG is able to do so it forms a more stable
paired complex with the RSS binding sites than when nicking is inhibited.


## Significance
V(D)J recombination is a critical genomic cut-and-paste process for
generating diverse antibody repertoires. The RAG enzyme must bring
spatially separated gene segments together and cut the DNA by binding the
neighboring recombination signal sequences (RSSs). Despite extensive
biochemical characterization, quantitative studies of the
sequence-dependent effects on the crucial intermediate steps in the RAG-RSS
dynamics are limited. By observing RAG interactions with a variety of
endogenous and synthetic RSS sequences at the single-molecule level, we learn
that while RSSs of frequently- used gene segments may not enhance formation
or cleavage of the paired complex state any more than the RSSs of
less-frequently selected segments, the rare use of some gene segments in
recombination can be explained by their neighbor- ing RSSs crippling one of
these two processes. Our in-depth analysis on paired complex lifetimes also
reveal that nicking is not a prerequisite for forming the paired complex, but
paired complexes with nicks to the DNA backbone are more stable and can
remain in the paired complex state for longer than those without nicks.
Further, reversal of the paired complex state does not obey a simple Poisson
process. These results suggest a more complicated binding interaction between
RAG and RSS, the uncovering of which will provide a more detailed kinetic
description of RAG-RSS dynamics and may reveal further insights into the
affected steps of this reaction when tuning RSS sequence.
